## Abstract
Recently, numerous studies have been conducted on supervised learning-based image denoising methods. However, these methods rely on large-scale noisy-clean image pairs, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Denoising methods with self-supervised training that can be trained with only noisy images have been proposed to address the limitation. These methods are based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown promising performance. However, CNN-based methods do not consider using nonlocal self-similarities essential in the traditional method, which can cause performance limitations. This paper presents self-similarity attention (SS-Attention), a novel self-attention module that can capture nonlocal self-similarities to solve the problem. We focus on designing a lightweight self-attention module in a pixel-wise manner, which is nearly impossible to implement using the classic self-attention module due to the quadratically increasing complexity with spatial resolution. Furthermore, we integrate SS-Attention into the blind-spot network called self-similarity-based blind-spot network (SS-BSN). We conduct the experiments on real-world image denoising tasks. The proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods in self-supervised denoising on the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) benchmark datasets.
